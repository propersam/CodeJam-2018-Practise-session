Problem

A "0/1 string" is a string in which every character is either 0 or 1. There are two operations that can be performed on a 0/1 string:

switch: Every 0 becomes 1 and every 1 becomes 0. For example, "100" becomes "011".
reverse: The string is reversed. For example, "100" becomes "001".
Consider this infinite sequence of 0/1 strings:

S0 = ""

S1 = "0"

S2 = "001"

S3 = "0010011"

S4 = "001001100011011"

...
SN = SN-1 + "0" + switch(reverse(SN-1)).

You need to figure out the Kth character of Sgoogol, where googol = 10100

Input:

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
Each of the next T lines contains a number K.

Output:

For each test case, output one line containing 
"Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) 
and y is the Kth character of Sgoogol.

Limits
1 <= T <= 100

Small dataset
1 <= K <= 10^5

Large dataset
1 <= K <= 10^18
